# intel_bug_detection
This project implements a Bug Detection and Fixing Model using FastAPI for deployment and LinearSVC (Support Vector Machine) for bug classification. It detects bugs in code snippets, suggests fixes using regex-based patterns, and provides a simple web interface. You can access the model remotely using LocalTunnel or Ngrok.
